# Website for a Rice Sales Company - University Project

This project was a final assignment for the Website Design course, in which students were required to utilize their HTML and CSS coding skills acquired throughout the semester. The goal was to design and develop a website for a fictional rice sales company, which was entirely conceptualized by me. The website showcases various rice products, company information, and contact details, all presented in a visually appealing and user-friendly format. The website was designed and developed with attention to detail, and the HTML and CSS files were validated using the W3C website validation tool.

In addition to using HTML and CSS, I also incorporated a bit of PHP code into the project, which was not a requirement for the assignment but something I wanted to try out.
